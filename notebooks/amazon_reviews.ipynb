There is a \"Fresh and Fruity\" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled \"I Scream for Quick Pops!\", \"Bake Shop\", and  \"Coco Loco\". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on \"Tips\" and \"Techniques\" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially help...</td>\n",

       "2           There is no shortage of pop recipes available for free on the web, but I purchased the \"Zoku Quick Pops\" book, because Zoku has some good recipes for fruit pops on its blog. I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a \"Fresh and Fruity\" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled \"I Scream for Quick Pops!\", \"Bake Shop\", and  \"Coco Loco\". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on \"Tips\" and \"Techniques\" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially help...   \n",

There is a large variety of recipes from simple, to fancy. The flavor combos are creative, and it gives you ideas for decorating the pops too. They turn out as beautiful as they are tasty. After reading it you will be inspired to create your own recipes too.   \n",

I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others, but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far, but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one, and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also, it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended.   \n",

Bright kid-happy colors in just the right size portions.  I received the package very quickly and immediately washed them out and filled them with different juice combos -- the next morning when I took one out to try it, it was tough to get the little lid off, but just a second or two under running water loosened things up enough to easily remove the lid.  Very soft, squeezable molds with ridges that make them easy to grip -- and easy to push the pop up... looking forward to trying many different flavor combos over the summer!   \n",

Since we have an abundance of orange juice at the moment, I poured some in each mold.  Within a couple hours, they were frozen.  I surprised the kids after they spent the afternoon swimming, and they were very excited about their orange juice pops.  The molds worked great.  I love that they have lids so they are individually self contained.  The kids liked that they weren't messy as they melted.  Now the kids are begging me to make pudding pops.  We'll be using these a lot this summer!!!   \n",

It doesn't give any explanation of the meaning or how it can be used. I should have sent it bk., but I factored in the cost of return shipping - wasn't worth the return.       1.0   \n",
       "139         I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback, it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it.       1.0   \n",

I have used it to chop ginger root, garlic, onions, peppers, and cherry tomatoes. I like the way I can control the amount of chopping such as in the case of the cherry tomatoes since I did not want to make them into a sauce but just chopped; this product gave me good control. The other food items were finely chopped, and the recipes came out great: talapia in lemon sauce, lemony salmon, and orange chicken. Spooning the chopped food out of the container was very easy, and the clean up was likewise. I appreciate the reviews that helped me select this item for our kitchen. Thanks.       5.0   \n",

       "review        This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement. Since the blender was purchased as a gift (from our wedding registry), we did not have \"proof of purchase\" and Cuisinart did not honor the 3-year warranty.We purchased a replacement part from CuisinartWebstore.com (~$21 with shipping) and got through another ~10 uses before that cutter assembly broke as well. This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer \"service\" again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service.\n",

       "139         I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback, it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it.       one   \n",

I have used it to chop ginger root, garlic, onions, peppers, and cherry tomatoes. I like the way I can control the amount of chopping such as in the case of the cherry tomatoes since I did not want to make them into a sauce but just chopped; this product gave me good control. The other food items were finely chopped, and the recipes came out great: talapia in lemon sauce, lemony salmon, and orange chicken. Spooning the chopped food out of the container was very easy, and the clean up was likewise. I appreciate the reviews that helped me select this item for our kitchen. Thanks.      five   \n",
